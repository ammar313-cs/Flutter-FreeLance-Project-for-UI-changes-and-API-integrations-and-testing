# Flutter HRM App Description

This Flutter HRM (Human Resource Management) app was developed as part of a freelance project. The app underwent UI enhancements, API integration, and Postman API testing. While I did not own the entire codebase, I made significant contributions by implementing UI changes, integrating APIs, and conducting Postman API testing before integration.

## Features

- **UI Enhancements**: Implemented UI changes to improve user experience and visual appeal.
- **API Integration**: Integrated APIs to fetch and update HR-related data within the app.
- **Postman API Testing**: Conducted thorough testing of APIs using Postman to ensure reliability and functionality.
- **Configuration and Setup**: Configured Flutter dependencies and made necessary adjustments for seamless integration with APIs.
- **Code Refactoring**: Added new code blocks and refactored existing code for improved efficiency and readability.
